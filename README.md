The [Magnus effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect) explains why
footballs curve/curl when kicked with spin, or why [dropping a ball with
backspin causes it to move forwards as it falls to the
ground](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/563806/how-can-you-model-how-far-a-spinning-cylinder-will-move-forward-during-free-fall/563847#563847).

This repository hosts a [simple
simulation](https://joeiddon.github.io/magnus_effect) of the effect. See my
physics.stackexchange answer (linked above) for the Maths behind it.
